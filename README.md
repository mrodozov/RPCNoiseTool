# RPCNoiseTool

Main executable for link board monitor files analysis.
Original author is unknown.
This code runs on the edge of 'least requirements' and
it's like a tutorial on 'how not to program', but anyway
it contains policies (on thresholds etc.) that cannot 
be changed without collaboration decisions. 
Needs to be completely re-written since it's maintenance
hell.
